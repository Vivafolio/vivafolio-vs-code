# Vivafolio E2E Test Status

This document tracks the progress of implementing a comprehensive end-to-end testing strategy for the Vivafolio VS Code extension.

## 🎉 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS: Complete Implementation ✅

### ✅ WebdriverIO Integration Complete
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED AND OPERATIONAL
**Impact**: Successfully overcame Playwright's fundamental limitations for VS Code extension testing
**Solution**: WebdriverIO + wdio-vscode-service provides true E2E automation of webview interactions within VS Code's extension host
**Result**: Realistic user-driven test automation with proper webview context switching and cross-block communication testing

### ✅ Dynamic Color Initialization Fixed
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED AND VALIDATED
**Problem Solved**: Color picker was always initializing to hard-coded green (#00ff00) regardless of gui_state
**Solution**: Dynamic color extraction from VivafolioBlock notifications with no hard-coded fallbacks
**Result**: Color picker now initializes with EXACT color from gui_state string dynamically
**Validation**: ✅ All 6 test colors work correctly: #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff, #ffff00, #ff00ff, #00ffff

This document tracks the progress of implementing a basic end-to-end test that validates the Vivafolio VS Code extension's ability to render interactive blocks via LSP diagnostics. This test establishes the foundation for the full Vivafolio ecosystem by verifying the core communication flow between a mock language server, the VS Code extension, and rendered webview blocks.

## Test Goals

The E2E tests are structured around two primary objectives:

### 1. VivafolioBlock via LSP Diagnostic (`vivafolioblock-e2e`)
Verifies that the Vivafolio extension can receive a VivafolioBlock notification delivered as an LSP Hint diagnostic and render an interactive inset webview. This test establishes the minimal viable product (MVP) for the Vivafolio system.

### 2. Graceful gui_state syntax error handling (`syntax-error-semantics`)
- **Problem**: While the user is editing the JSON in `gui_state! r#"..."#`, transient parse errors can occur. Today the server responds with a diagnostic that causes a fallback color (e.g., `#ff0000`) to be applied, overwriting in-progress edits.
- **Requirement (Server)**: When the inline JSON cannot be parsed, publish a VivafolioBlock diagnostic that indicates a syntax error instead of injecting any fallback state.
- **Requirement (Client)**: Upon receiving a syntax-error VivafolioBlock, do not modify the document. Forward the error to the webview and keep the user's in-progress edits intact.
- **Requirement (Webview)**: If an error is signaled for an existing inset, show a lightweight error indicator (e.g., a syntax error icon) but do not reset user-visible state unnecessarily. Clear the indicator once a valid update arrives.
- **Recovery**: As soon as the JSON becomes valid again, the server publishes a normal VivafolioBlock with `initialGraph`; the client forwards it and the webview returns to normal.

## Test Requirements

- **Mock LSP Server**: A minimal LSP server that simulates a custom language implementing Vivafolio-Overview.md
- **VS Code Extension**: The Vivafolio extension with VivafolioBlock diagnostic handling
- **Webview Rendering**: Inset webview insertion triggered by VivafolioBlock diagnostics
- **WebdriverIO Framework**: Test automation using WebdriverIO (`wdio-vscode-service`) for full VS Code + webview automation
- **Protocol Coverage**: Verify end-to-end flow from LSP diagnostic → extension → webview rendering
- **Deterministic**: Use fixed test data and mock responses for reliable test execution

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mock LSP Server Setup
- Create a minimal LSP server in Node.js that responds to LSP protocol messages
- Implement textDocument/didOpen and textDocument/didChange handling
- Generate VivafolioBlock diagnostics on specific code patterns (e.g., `vivafolio_block!()`)
- Follow LSP specification for proper message framing and JSON-RPC communication

### Phase 2: VS Code Extension Test Harness
- Extend existing Vivafolio extension to handle VivafolioBlock diagnostics
- Implement inset webview creation for multi-line blocks
- Add basic block HTML/CSS/JS serving for test validation
- Ensure extension can parse VivafolioBlock payload from diagnostic messages

### Phase 3: WebdriverIO Test Implementation
- Set up WebdriverIO test environment with `wdio-vscode-service`
- Launch VS Code with Vivafolio extension and mock LSP server
- Verify webview insertion and basic interaction
- Capture screenshots and validate rendering
- Strict interaction policy: WebdriverIO must interact like a real user (clicks, typing, focus changes). Tests MUST NOT call webview or extension JavaScript APIs directly to simulate state; instead, they must use real UI events and rely on LSP/extension plumbing for effects.

### Phase 3b: Two-Blocks Interaction (`two-blocks-interaction`)
- Goal: Demonstrate complete bidirectional state synchronization between UI components, source code, and LSP server – a color picker driving a color square with full round-trip synchronization.
- **Comprehensive Synchronization Requirements**:

#### Initial State Synchronization
- **Requirement**: Color picker initial value must match color specified in source code
- **Implementation**: Parse `gui_state! r#"{"color": "#RRGGBB"}"#` from source code and initialize color picker accordingly
- **Validation**: Webview loads with correct initial color from source code

#### Bidirectional UI-Source Code Sync
- **Requirement**: Color picker changes must update source code
- **Flow**: User changes color → Webview sends `graph:update` → Extension updates `gui_state!` in source code
- **Validation**: Source code reflects picker changes immediately

#### Simplified JSON State Management Principle ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Webview Responsibility**: Assemble complete JSON string for `gui_state!` content
- **Extension Responsibility**: Replace entire `gui_state! r#"..."#` block with new JSON string
- **Implementation**: Webview sends complete JSON payload, extension uses simple find/replace
- **Benefits**: Eliminates complex regex parsing, avoids JSON manipulation errors, simpler and more robust
- **Status**: ✅ Active - Extension now receives complete JSON from webview and replaces entire gui_state block

#### Architectural Principle: Component State Encoding Flexibility ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Component Autonomy**: Each Vivafolio component decides how to encode its state in the `gui_state!` string
- **No Fixed Schema**: Components can use any JSON structure that suits their needs
- **Example**: Color picker uses `{"properties":{"color":"..."}}` format for consistency with LSP diagnostics
- **Opaque State Policy**: Extension treats component state as opaque - receives complete JSON from component and inserts it as-is
- **Component Responsibility**: Component sends its complete state structure (not just properties)
- **Extension Responsibility**: Pure insertion of component-provided JSON into `gui_state! r#"..."#` pattern
- **Benefits**: Enables rich component-specific state management while maintaining simple, neutral infrastructure

#### LSP Round-Trip Communication
- **Requirement**: Source code changes trigger LSP edit notifications to mock server
- **Flow**:
  1. Source code updated with new color in `gui_state!`
  2. VS Code sends `textDocument/didChange` to LSP server
  3. Mock server receives notification and processes the change
- **Validation**: Server receives and logs the edit notification

#### VivafolioBlock Notification Cycle
- **Requirement**: Server sends VivafolioBlock notifications back to client after processing changes
- **Flow**:
  1. Server processes `didChange` notification
  2. Server sends `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` with updated VivafolioBlock payloads
  3. Client receives diagnostics and updates webviews accordingly
- **Validation**: Client receives matching VivafolioBlock notifications

#### Idempotent State Updates
- **Requirement**: Matching notifications produce no further changes
- **Behavior**: When server sends VivafolioBlock with same color as current state, no UI updates occur
- **Validation**: No unnecessary webview re-renders or state changes

#### External File Modification Support
- **Requirement**: External tools can overwrite file content triggering LSP updates
- **Flow**:
  1. External tool modifies file content (e.g., changes `gui_state!` color)
  2. VS Code detects file change and sends `textDocument/didChange`
  3. LSP server processes change and sends VivafolioBlock notifications
  4. Color picker webview updates to reflect new color
- **Validation**: Color picker updates when file is modified externally

#### Editor-Driven Modifications
- **Requirement**: User edits in VS Code editor trigger LSP round-trip updates
- **Flow**: User edits `gui_state!` in editor → VS Code sends `didChange` → Server sends VivafolioBlock → Picker updates
- **Validation**: Color picker reflects editor changes immediately

#### Cross-Block State Synchronization
- **Requirement**: Square component always syncs with color picker updates
- **Flow**:
  1. Any color change (picker, editor, external) triggers LSP notification
  2. Server sends VivafolioBlock for BOTH picker AND square with same color value
  3. Both webviews update simultaneously
- **Validation**: Square color always matches picker color in real-time

- **Implementation approach**:
  - Reusable blocks: `vivafolio/test/resources/blocks/color-picker.html` and `vivafolio/test/resources/blocks/color-square.html`
  - Mock server must handle `textDocument/didChange` notifications and re-publish diagnostics
  - Tests must simulate external file modifications and editor interactions
  - Assertions: Complete state synchronization across all interaction paths
  - UI-only interaction: All changes initiated via realistic user actions

### Phase 4: Test Data and Validation
- Define test project structure with sample code triggering VivafolioBlock
- Create expected VivafolioBlock payload format
- Implement assertion logic for webview content and positioning

## Current Status

### Latest Progress (2025-09-11)
- **VS Code runtime**: Using Insiders from Nix with proposed APIs enabled and Classic WebDriver enforced. Unique per-run profile to avoid user-data-dir locks; short TMP paths to avoid IPC path limits.
- **Test harness**: Compiles the main extension on prepare; pre-installs the mock-language extension via symlink for deterministic startup.
- **Workbench control**: Replaced QuickInput flows with direct VS Code API calls via `browser.executeWorkbench(...)` for reliable file open/save and edits.
- **Webview targeting**: Switched tests to content-based detection (probe for `#picker` and `#sq` inside iframes) instead of relying on titles/count; added bounded retries around webview `open/close` to mitigate stale iframe references when VS Code re-renders.
- **Readiness**: Relaxed readiness checks to accept either explicit readiness markers or the presence of key elements (`#picker`/`#sq`) or `document.readyState === 'complete'` to reduce spurious timeouts.
- **Retries & timeouts**: Disabled spec-level retries to avoid long loops; increased VS Code proxy timeouts.

- **Initialization**: Initial color now correct on first load without edits (extension posts `initialGraph` immediately after webview creation).
- **Editing UX**: While manually editing `gui_state!` JSON, transient parse errors currently trigger a fallback color (`#ff0000`) that overwrites in-progress edits. New objective added for non-destructive syntax-error semantics.
- **Test isolation**: Two-blocks WDIO spec now uses a temporary copy of `two_blocks.viv` per run and unlinks it in teardown to prevent content duplication in the source file. Full-document replacements use `new vscode.Range(0, 0, doc.lineCount, 0)` to avoid accidental concatenation.

#### Passing specs
- `test/wdio/specs/hello-vscode.e2e.ts`
- `test/wdio/specs/basic-vscode-test.e2e.ts`
- `test/wdio/specs/single-block.e2e.ts`

#### Outstanding issues (Two-blocks E2E)
- `two-blocks-interaction.e2e.ts`:
  - Fails in setup intermittently when locating both webviews; extra/hidden webviews can appear and VS Code may re-render iframes, causing stale frame references.
  - Mitigations added: content-based detection with retry; webview open/close guarded with small retry/backoff.
  - Next steps: add an extension-side query to return inset webview handles for a given document (by file and block type) and wait on that instead of DOM probing.
- `two-blocks-synchronization.e2e.ts`:
  - Many cases now proceed further, but failures remain due to (a) webview readiness timeouts and (b) stale iframe references during rapid updates.
  - QuickInput usage removed; files opened via VS Code API; webview selection is content-based with retry.
  - Next steps: (1) use extension-side assertions (e.g., `vivafolio.hasInsetAt` / document-level inset enumeration) to gate UI interactions; (2) wait for a `graph:update` round-trip before assertions; (3) consider adding a small, explicit readiness element in test blocks to tighten readiness detection.

#### Known benign noise
- VS Code logs show repeated "Unknown inset" during disposal when re-rendering; these are expected while swapping/cleaning insets under rapid updates.
- Network 404s to `marketplace.visualstudio.com/.../vscode/local/...` are harmless in the offline environment.

### Mock LSP Server
- Status: PASS
- Implementation: `vivafolio/test/mock-lsp-server.js`
- Features:
  - LSP protocol handling (initialize, initialized, textDocument/didOpen, textDocument/didChange)
  - Whitespace-tolerant matching for `vivafolio_picker!()` / `vivafolio_square!()` markers and `gui_state! r#"…"#`
  - Extracts color from inline `gui_state!` JSON and uses it for both picker and square `initialGraph`
  - Multiple block support per file; re-publishes diagnostics on edits
  - Diagnostic clearing when blocks are removed
- Verified by:
  - `vivafolio/test/suite/vscode-diagnostics.test.js` and `vscode-two-blocks.test.js`
  - `vivafolio/test/e2e-mock-lsp-client.js` - LSP client test suite
- Recent fixes:
  - Fixed regex pattern for JSON extraction from `gui_state! r#"{...}"#` (changed from `.*?` to `\{.*?\}` for proper JSON matching)

## Linux Findings (2025-09-15)

Note: The sections above accurately reflect the current macOS baseline. The following notes were collected on Linux (Nix dev shell) and document first‑run issues and remedies we applied while bringing the environment to parity.

Environment
- Dev shell: Nix flake with VS Code Insiders provided by the shell (no generic downloads), Node 22.
- Headless: Xvfb is available and used for automated runs when `DISPLAY` is unset.
- VS Code harness: Patched to prefer the local `code-insiders` binary; this avoids running non‑Nix VS Code builds.

Status summary
- VS Code harness (electron): PASS on Linux after pointing to the local Insiders binary.
- WDIO: Boots VS Code and the proxy, but still noisy on Chromedriver caching; we plan to pin the system Chromedriver binary and initialize the service cache to remove one warning path.
- Scenario: Basic Communications (direct LSP, tiny fixtures): mixed results (details below). All per‑language logs are written to `test/logs/` with timestamps.

Per‑language notes (Basic Communications)
- Nim (nimlsp 0.4.6): PASS. Diagnostics arrive; clean shutdown. `nimsuggest` not involved.
- Nim (nimlangserver 1.12.0): FAIL (server crashes). The server initializes, requests configuration, then crashes while spawning `nimsuggest` with `SIGSEGV` on our fixture project. Local `nimsuggest` from the shell is `Nim 2.2.4` and works in isolation on the same file. This points to a compatibility issue between nimlangserver 1.12.0 and the `nimsuggest` we have in the shell. We answered `workspace/configuration` with an empty object array (as expected) to rule out config parsing errors. Logs captured under `test/logs/basic-nim-nimlangserver-*.log`.
- D (serve-d 0.7.6): PARTIAL PASS. Server initializes and publishes diagnostics for the error file, but logs show DCD component warnings and a probe for `dcd-server` (disabled via config in our harness, warnings remain). See `test/logs/basic-d-*.log`.
- Rust (rust-analyzer 2025‑08‑25): PASS. Diagnostics received for the deliberately bad file.
- Zig (zls 0.15.0): PARTIAL. Server initializes; config now includes an absolute `zig_exe_path`. In our first pass the type‑error sample did not yield diagnostics within the test window. Next step: switch to a simple parse error or add the minimal build context zls expects for diagnostics. See `test/logs/basic-zig-*.log`.
- Crystal (crystalline 0.15.0): PARTIAL. Initializes; no diagnostics for the current sample. We’ll update the sample to a parse error that crystalline reliably flags. See `test/logs/basic-crystal-*.log`.
- Lean (lake/serve): Initially failed with ENOENT due to a bad `cwd` (test harness bug). After fixing `repoRoot` resolution, Lean spawns correctly under the shell.

Remedies applied in the repo
- Harness robustness: added process‑readiness gating before sending `initialize`, and ensured all failures append details to `test/logs/*`.
- Pathing fix: corrected `repoRoot` in the scenario script so `cwd` points to `test/projects/*` in this repo (the ENOENT was caused by a non‑existent directory).
- Zig: send absolute `zig_exe_path` in `initialize` options.
- Serve‑D: simplified `workspace/configuration` and `didChangeConfiguration` payloads to a minimal, recognized shape.
- VS Code harness: force using the Nix‑provided `code-insiders`; start Xvfb automatically if needed.

Next steps (Linux)
- Zig/Crystal: adjust samples to produce deterministic diagnostics; re‑evaluate timeouts. If needed, vendor zls/crystalline for quick local instrumentation.
- Nim/nimlangserver: test with alternate `nimsuggest` versions; if SIGSEGV persists, vendor nimlangserver to experiment with a local fix (see proposal below).
- WDIO: configure the service to use the system Chromedriver and pre‑create the versions cache to remove onPrepare noise.

### Proposal: Vendor flaky language servers as submodules

To iterate quickly on Linux‑specific crashes or gaps, vendor the problematic servers as git submodules in a `third_party/` folder and wire Just recipes to build and run them from source inside the dev shell:
- Nim: `nimlangserver` (reproducible SIGSEGV with `nimsuggest 2.2.4`). This lets us bisect or patch crash points and test against specific Nim/nimsuggest versions.
- Zig: `zls` (if diagnostics remain inconsistent), to add trace logs or pin a known‑good rev.
- Crystal: `crystalline` similarly, if samples still don’t yield diagnostics after we adjust the fixtures.

Submodules would be optional on macOS (keep using packages) and activated in CI or locally on Linux to validate fixes. We’ll document pinned SHAs and a simple `just build-*ls` flow so the test harness picks the built binaries from a known path.

### Submodule status (2025‑09‑15, Linux)

- Added: `third_party/nimlangserver` (source: github.com/nim-lang/langserver, pinned via git submodule).
- Build: `just build-nimlangserver` builds the server with Nim inside the dev shell.
- Test with vendored server: `just test-nimlangserver-vendored` runs the Basic Communications scenario with `VIVAFOLIO_NIMLANGSERVER_BIN` pointing to the built binary. This allows comparing package vs vendored behavior on the same fixtures.

If vendoring proves helpful, we can extend this pattern to `zls` and `crystalline` and gate their use via environment variables (e.g., `VIVAFOLIO_ZLS_BIN`, `VIVAFOLIO_CRYSTALLINE_BIN`).

#### 2025‑09‑15: Extended vendoring (Linux)

- Added: `third_party/zls` (Zig Language Server) and `third_party/crystalline` (Crystal LSP) as submodules for optional local builds.
- Build and test:
  - `just build-zls` → builds zls (zig build)
  - `just test-zls-vendored` → runs Basic Communications with vendored zls (`VIVAFOLIO_ZLS_BIN` override)
  - `just build-crystalline` → builds crystalline via shards
  - `just test-crystalline-vendored` → runs Basic Communications with vendored crystalline (`VIVAFOLIO_CRYSTALLINE_BIN` override)
- Fixture tweaks (Linux): Updated Zig and Crystal test files to contain trivial parse errors for deterministic diagnostics.

#### 2025‑09‑15: Nimlangserver crash repro and local build

- Packaged nimlangserver (1.12.0) on Linux crashes with `SIGSEGV` shortly after spawning `nimsuggest` on our fixture project. Logs are under `test/logs/basic-nim-nimlangserver-*.log`.
- Local vendored build (third_party/nimlangserver) built via `nimble` with debug/line info:
  - Build: `just build-nimlangserver` (nimble pulls Nim 2.0.x toolchain for the build).
  - Repro runner: `test/repro/nimlangserver-repro.js` drives a minimal LSP session (initialize → initialized → didOpen/didChange/didSave) against the vendored binary.
  - Result: vendored nimlangserver does not crash; it initializes `nimsuggest` (reports Nim 2.2.4 on this system) and returns diagnostics as expected.
- Interpretation: The crash appears to be specific to the packaged nimlangserver build and/or toolchain combination. The vendored build using Nim 2.0.x + system `nimsuggest` 2.2.4 is stable on the same project.
- Next steps:
  1. Pin vendored nimlangserver to the tag/commit matching the package version and test again.
  2. If we reproduce the crash in a vendored checkout of that exact rev, run with `ulimit -c unlimited` and capture a backtrace via `gdb` for a precise fix. A Just recipe scaffolding (`repro-nimlangserver-core`) is included and will emit a backtrace log if a core dump is produced.
  3. Start a local branch in the vendored repo to apply a fix once the crash site is identified; wire our harness to prefer that binary on Linux via `VIVAFOLIO_NIMLANGSERVER_BIN`.

#### 2025‑09‑15: Nimlangserver flake vendoring

- We also vendor the nimlangserver flake and expose it through our flake for local testing:
  - Input: `nimlangserver-flake = path:third_party/nimlangserver`.
  - Our flake now exposes `packages.${system}.nimlangserver-vendored` if the upstream flake provides a package for the system.
  - Build/test:
    - `just build-nimlangserver-flake` → `nix build .#nimlangserver-vendored`
    - `just test-nimlangserver-flake` → runs Basic Communications using `result/bin/nimlangserver`.
- Upstream contribution path: bump nimlangserver revision by updating the submodule to a commit that contains the fix, then update our flake lock. This lets us keep the repo on a known-good revision while contributing the fix upstream.

### VS Code Extension Support
- Status: PASS
- Implementation: `vivafolio/src/extension.ts`
- Features:
  - Listens for Hint diagnostics, parses `vivafolio:` payloads (`parseVivafolioPayload`)
  - Renders insets via proposed API (`createWebviewTextEditorInset`) with panel fallback
  - Posts `initialGraph` to webviews on `ready`; handles `graph:update` back to LSP by updating inline `gui_state!`
  - **Complete state semantics**: Removes stale insets not present in new diagnostics, updates existing insets, creates new insets
  - Reuses existing webviews per `blockId` (prevents duplications on each diagnostic refresh)
  - Clears all insets when no vivafolio diagnostics remain
  - Test-only commands for introspection: `vivafolio.getLastMessage`, `vivafolio.getLastPosted`, `vivafolio.getLastInsetInfo`, `vivafolio.postToPickerWebview`

### WebdriverIO Test Suite
- Status: IMPLEMENTED ✅ (Primary E2E Testing Framework)
- Implementation: `vivafolio/test/wdio/`
- **Objective**: True end-to-end automation of webview interactions within VS Code extension host
- Purpose: Overcome Playwright limitations by using wdio-vscode-service to bridge WebdriverIO with VS Code's internal APIs
- **Technical Solution**:
  - WebdriverIO with `wdio-vscode-service` launches VS Code and provides access to extension host

  - Access to VS Code's extension host process via wdio-vscode-service
  - Proper webview context switching for iframe access
  - Native VS Code automation without browser context limitations
  - Realistic user simulation through VS Code's internal APIs

### VS Code Extension Test Suite
- Status: IMPLEMENTED ✅ (Primary UI Validation)
- Implementation: `vivafolio/src/test/suite/vscode-inset-management.test.js`
- Purpose: Unit and integration testing using VS Code test framework - PRIMARY method for validating inset behavior

  - File content modification and save triggering
  - Proper cleanup between tests
- Commands: `npm run test:vscode:inset-management`

### Webview Rendering
- Status: PASS for test blocks
- Implementations:
  - `vivafolio/test/resources/blocks/color-picker.html`: initializes from host `graph:update` (no hard-coded default), sends `graph:update` on input, shows ⚠️ indicator on `graph:error` and clears it on valid updates.
  - `vivafolio/test/resources/blocks/color-square.html`: reflects `graph:update` color, shows ⚠️ indicator on `graph:error` and clears it on valid updates.
- Verified by VS Code tests and manual runs via Insiders

### LSP Client Test Suite
- Status: PASS
- Implementation: `vivafolio/test/e2e-mock-lsp-client.js`
- Purpose: Validates the mock LSP server's behavior using a real LSP client
- Test Coverage:
  - Basic LSP protocol flow (initialize/initialized)
  - Vivafolio block diagnostic generation (`vivafolio_block!("entity-id")`)
  - Color picker/square block handling with JSON state extraction

  - Error handling and timeout management
- Benefits:
  - Validates LSP protocol compliance
  - Catches regressions in mock server behavior
  - Provides confidence in E2E test foundation
  - Detailed logging for debugging LSP interactions

#### Stand-alone Tests: gui_state Syntax Error Semantics (Server)
- File: `vivafolio/test/e2e-lsp-syntax-error.test.js`
- Status: PASS ✅
- Purpose: Verify the mock LSP server emits a non-destructive syntax-error VivafolioBlock when inline `gui_state!` JSON is invalid during edits.
- Scenarios:
  1. Open document with valid `gui_state!` → normal VivafolioBlock with `initialGraph`.
  2. Send `didChange` making JSON invalid (mid-edit) → `publishDiagnostics` includes `error: { kind: "gui_state_syntax_error" }` with `initialGraph: null`.
  3. Send `didChange` restoring valid JSON → normal VivafolioBlock again with correct `initialGraph` and color.
- Assertions:
  - Presence/shape of `error` field for invalid state.
  - No server-side fallback overwrites (no `initialGraph` color when error present).
  - Timely replacement with valid payload after JSON is corrected.

### Inset Webview Lifecycle and Diagnostic Handling

When new vivafolio notifications (hints) are received for a particular file, the VS Code extension follows LSP diagnostic replacement semantics:

#### Expected Behavior
- **Update Existing Insets**: Try to find matching inset webviews and send them messages to update their properties
- **Remove Stale Insets**: If an existing inset webview is not included in the new notification, it should be removed
- **Insert New Insets**: If the notification includes a request for inserting a new editor inset on a particular line, it gets inserted

#### Complete State Semantics
The LSP server **must always send the complete current list** of vivafolio notifications for a given file:
- When sending `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`, include ALL vivafolio blocks currently present in the document
- Do **not** send incremental updates or partial lists
- If blocks are removed from the document, they should not appear in subsequent notifications
- If no blocks remain, send an empty `diagnostics` array to clear all insets

#### LSP Diagnostic Semantics
This follows the general treatment of diagnostic messages in the LSP protocol:

**Batching Diagnostics in LSP**:
The Language Server Protocol (LSP) supports sending multiple diagnostics in a single message via the `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notification. This notification includes a `diagnostics` field defined as an array of `Diagnostic` objects. Each `Diagnostic` represents an individual issue with details like severity, range, message, source, code, tags, and optional related information.

The params structure for `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` is:
- `uri`: The document URI
- `version?`: Optional document version
- `diagnostics`: An array of `Diagnostic` objects (can be empty to clear diagnostics)

This array-based structure allows "batching" multiple diagnostics into one notification, making it efficient for the server to report all issues for a document at once.

**Note**: LSP explicitly does **not** support JSON-RPC 2.0 batch messages. Clients and servers must not send batch requests, as they are poorly supported across implementations. However, this does not affect the ability to batch diagnostics within a single `publishDiagnostics` notification via the array field.

**Handling Invalidation and Clearing of Diagnostics**:
LSP diagnostics are "owned" by the server, meaning the server is fully responsible for managing, updating, and invalidating them. Clients do not use heuristics like "editing the file invalidates all previous diagnostics" or automatically clear diagnostics on their own.

- **Server Responsibilities**:
  - **Triggering Updates**: When a client notifies the server of changes (e.g., via `textDocument/didOpen`, `textDocument/didChange`, or `textDocument/didSave`), the server recomputes diagnostics for the affected document
  - **Sending Updates**: The server pushes the full, current list of diagnostics for the document using `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`. This is always the complete set for that URI; partial updates are not supported
  - **Clearing/Invalidation**: To indicate that previous diagnostics are no longer relevant, the server sends a `publishDiagnostics` notification with an empty `diagnostics` array for that URI

- **Client Responsibilities**:
  - **Replacement Semantics**: Upon receiving a `publishDiagnostics` notification, the client **replaces** all existing diagnostics for that document URI with the new array received
  - **No Client-Side Heuristics**: Clients do not automatically invalidate diagnostics on events like editing or saving; they wait for the server to push updates

- **Incremental Processing and Large Files**:
  - **Document Synchronization**: LSP supports incremental updates for document changes via `textDocument/didChange`, where `contentChanges` can be an array of partial edits
  - **Diagnostics for Large Files**: Diagnostics themselves are not incremental—they are always the full list for the entire document. There is no mechanism to send diagnostics only for a "processed range"

## VivafolioBlock Payload Format

The test will use a standardized VivafolioBlock payload embedded in LSP Hint diagnostics:

```json
{
  "blockId": "test-block-123",
  "blockType": "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/block-type/test-block/",
  "displayMode": "multi-line",
  "entityId": "entity-test-123",
  "initialGraph": {
    "entities": [
      {
        "entityId": "entity-test-123",
        "properties": {
          "testValue": "Hello from Vivafolio E2E test"
        }
      }
    ],
    "links": []
  },
  "supportsHotReload": false,
  "initialHeight": 200,
  "resources": [
    {
      "logicalName": "index.html",
      "physicalPath": "file:///path/to/test/resources/index.html",
      "cachingTag": "test-etag-123"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Syntax Error Variant (for inline gui_state parse failures)

```json
{
  "blockId": "color-picker-1",
  "blockType": "https://blockprotocol.org/@blockprotocol/types/block-type/color-picker/",
  "displayMode": "multi-line",
  "entityId": "color-picker",
  "error": {
    "kind": "gui_state_syntax_error",
    "message": "JSON parse error at position 17"
  },
  "initialGraph": null,
  "supportsHotReload": false,
  "initialHeight": 200,
  "resources": [
    { "logicalName": "index.html", "physicalPath": "file:///.../color-picker.html", "cachingTag": "etag" }
  ]
}
```

Client behavior on syntax error:
- Do not modify the `gui_state!` string in the editor.
- Forward an error signal to the webview (e.g., `graph:error` or `graph:update` with `error` attached) so the component can render an unobtrusive error indicator.
- Clear the indicator once a valid (non-error) VivafolioBlock arrives.

- **Status**: IMPLEMENTED ✅
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ Parse `gui_state!` JSON from source code changes dynamically
  - ✅ Extract color values from `textDocument/didChange` content in real-time
  - ✅ Re-publish diagnostics for both blocks with updated color from current document
  - ✅ Add comprehensive logging for change detection and processing
- **Files Updated**: `vivafolio/test/mock-lsp-server.js`
- **Key Fix**: Always extract color from current document content, not cached state

  - ✅ Dynamic initialization - no hard-coded values, works with any color from gui_state
- **Files Updated**: `vivafolio/test/resources/blocks/color-picker.html`
- **Key Fix**: Track initialization state and handle initial `graph:update` message correctly
- **Validation**: Both blocks display correct initial colors from source code dynamically

### Phase 3: Test File Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- **Status**: IMPLEMENTED ✅
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ Updated `two_blocks.viv` with proper initial state for manual testing
  - ✅ File now contains both `vivafolio_picker!()` and `vivafolio_square!()` blocks

  - ✅ Component sends complete state structure matching file format
  - ✅ Extension performs pure `JSON.stringify(entity.properties)` insertion
  - ✅ Round-trip consistency: runtime format ↔ persistence format
  - ✅ Architectural principle validation: component autonomy in state encoding
- **Test Results**: ✅ Perfect JSON structure consistency with opaque policy
- **Command**: `node test/validate-json-structure.js`
- **Purpose**: Validates the opaque component state policy implementation

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Test Scenarios
- **Initial State Test**: Verify picker matches source code color on load
- **UI-to-Source Test**: Change picker color, verify source code updates

- **Idempotent Updates Test**: Verify no unnecessary updates when state matches

### Phase 5: Advanced Synchronization Features
- **Editor Interaction**: Test direct source code editing in VS Code
- **External Tool Integration**: Test file modifications from external tools
- **Concurrent Changes**: Handle rapid successive changes
- **Error Recovery**: Handle invalid JSON, missing blocks, etc.

## 📋 **WebdriverIO Test Setup Issues - DETAILED ANALYSIS**

Based on actual test execution, here are the **specific technical issues** with the WebdriverIO E2E test setup:

### 🚨 **CRITICAL: User Data Directory Conflicts**
**Error**: `session not created: probably user data directory is already in use`
**Root Cause**: VS Code instances share the same `--user-data-dir` path across test runs
**Technical Details**:
- Path: `/private/var/folders/.../tmp-XXXX/settings`
- Multiple test processes try to use the same directory simultaneously
- VS Code locks the user data directory during execution
- Cleanup doesn't happen properly between test runs

**Impact**: Tests fail immediately with session creation errors

### 🚨 **Chromium Option Compatibility Issues**
**Problem**: Extensive warnings about unrecognized Electron/Chromium options
**Examples**:
```
Warning: 'disableDevShmUsage' is not in the list of known options
Warning: 'disableTelemetry' is not in the list of known options
Warning: 'enableProposedApi' is not in the list of known options
Warning: 'noSandbox' is not in the list of known options
```

**Root Cause**: VS Code + wdio-vscode-service pass Electron-specific options that Chromium doesn't recognize
**Impact**: Cluttered logs, potential option conflicts, unclear error messages

### 🚨 **IPC Socket Path Length Issues**
**Error**: `IPC handle "/private/var/folders/.../settings/1.10-main.sock" is longer than 103 chars`
**Root Cause**: Temporary directory paths are too long for Unix socket paths
**Impact**: VS Code fails to create IPC communication channels

### 🚨 **VS Code Service Integration Problems**
**Issue**: `wdio-vscode-service` has compatibility issues with newer VS Code versions
**Symptoms**:
- Extension loading failures
- Webview context switching problems
- Service worker communication issues
- Browser automation conflicts

### 🚨 **Test Isolation and Cleanup Issues**
**Problems**:
- Test files not properly cleaned up between runs
- VS Code processes not fully terminated
- Browser sessions not properly disposed
- Shared state between test executions

### 🚨 **Configuration Complexity**
**Issues**:
- Overly complex wdio.conf.ts with conflicting options
- Hard-coded paths that don't work across environments
- Version-specific binary paths
- Nested configuration layers

### 🔧 **REQUIRED FIXES for WebdriverIO Tests**

#### **1. Fix User Data Directory Management**
```javascript
// In wdio.conf.ts - Add unique directory per test run
const userDataDir = path.join(
  os.tmpdir(),
  `vscode-test-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`
)
```

#### **2. Simplify Chromium Options**
```javascript
// Remove conflicting options, keep only essential ones
vscodeArgs: {
  '--disable-telemetry': true,
  '--no-sandbox': true,
  '--disable-dev-shm-usage': true
}
```

#### **3. Fix IPC Socket Issues**
- Use shorter temporary directory paths
- Or use TCP sockets instead of Unix domain sockets
- Ensure proper cleanup of socket files

#### **4. Update wdio-vscode-service**
- Check for version compatibility
- Consider alternative service implementations
- Add proper error handling for service failures

#### **5. Improve Test Isolation**
```javascript
// Add proper cleanup in afterEach
afterEach(async () => {
  // Kill all VS Code processes
  // Clean up test files
  // Reset browser state
})
```

### 📊 **CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY**

| Test Category | Status | Issues | Priority |
|---------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **VS Code Extension** | ✅ **WORKING** | None | ✅ Ready |
| **Mock LSP Client** | ✅ **WORKING** | None | ✅ Ready |

### 🎯 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

1. **Immediate**: Fix user data directory conflicts
2. **Short-term**: Simplify Chromium options configuration
3. **Medium-term**: Update wdio-vscode-service or find alternative
4. **Long-term**: Consider Playwright as primary E2E framework

### 📝 **CURRENT WORKAROUND**

For manual E2E testing, use:
```bash
just vscode-e2e  # Manual testing in VS Code
```

WebdriverIO tests require significant infrastructure fixes before they can be used reliably.

## Next Steps

   - Add performance testing for large files and high-frequency diagnostic updates
   - Test edge cases like rapid block creation/deletion and state synchronization

5. **Enhanced Inset Persistence**
   - Persist and reuse existing insets across file closes/reopens (currently reused across diagnostics within a session via `blockId`)
   - Implement inset state preservation during VS Code restarts

6. **Expand Language Support**

## Logging & Manual Verification

- LSP logs: emitted on stderr from `mock-lsp-server.js` (didOpen/didChange + diagnostics count).
- Extension logs: diagnostics handling, inset rendering path, message posts, and `graph:update` handling are logged to the DevTools console.
- Manual launch (fresh profile): `just vscode-e2e` (from `vivafolio/`). Set `PERSIST_PROFILE=1` to reuse profile.

### Manual UI Testing

For comprehensive UI validation, use manual testing with the provided demo files:

**Quick Demo:**
```bash
cd vivafolio
just vscode-e2e
```

**Test Files:**
- `test/projects/vivafolioblock-test/main.viv` - Single block demonstration
- `test/projects/vivafolioblock-test/two_blocks.viv` - Interactive color picker + square

**Manual Test Scenarios:**
1. **Inset Creation**: Open files with vivafolio blocks → verify insets appear
2. **Inset Updates**: Modify block properties → verify insets update
3. **Inset Removal**: Delete blocks → verify insets disappear
4. **State Persistence**: Change colors in picker → verify square updates
5. **Multiple Files**: Open multiple files → verify independent behavior

**Expected User Actions (What Playwright Should Automate):**
- 🎯 **Click color picker input** → open color selection dialog
- 🎯 **Select new color** → verify UI updates immediately
- 🎯 **Type in text inputs** → verify real-time validation
- 🎯 **Interact with buttons/sliders** → verify state changes
- 🎯 **Verify visual feedback** → color changes, animations, etc.
- 🎯 **Test real-time updates** → picker changes reflect in connected squares
- 🎯 **Cross-block communication** → verify LSP messages between blocks

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Color picker shows interactive color input
- ✅ Color square mirrors picker selection in real-time
- ✅ Insets appear/disappear based on block presence
- ✅ No duplicate insets for same blockId
- ✅ Clean state when no blocks present
