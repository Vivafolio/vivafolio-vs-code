# Vivafolio Block Development Architecture

This document defines the **target architecture** for block development, testing, and deployment across different environments. It clarifies the responsibilities of each component in the unified block ecosystem after the refactoring is complete.

## Current State vs. Target State

### Current State (Before Refactoring)
The POC demo server (`apps/blockprotocol-poc/src/server.ts`) currently handles **everything**:
- Framework compilation and hot-reload
- Entity graph management and Block Protocol messaging
- Static asset serving
- Test scenario management
- WebSocket communication

This creates confusion about which component does what and makes it difficult to reuse block development capabilities in other contexts.

### Target State (After Refactoring)
A clean separation of concerns where each component has a single, well-defined responsibility:
- **Block Builder & Server**: Focuses solely on building and serving blocks
- **Demo Application Server**: Orchestrates testing scenarios and delegates to IndexingService
- **IndexingService**: Handles entity graphs and Block Protocol operations
- **VS Code Extension**: Integrates everything in the production runtime

## Target Component Overview

### 1. Block Builder & Server (Block Development Only)
**Location**: `blocks/` directory, `src/dev-server.ts` (new)
**Purpose**: **Build, bundle, and serve block definitions during development**
**Responsibilities** (Target State):
- Framework compilation (SolidJS, Vue, Svelte, Lit, Angular)
- Block packaging and bundling
- Hot-reload development serving
- Cache invalidation hooks for VS Code integration
- REST API for block metadata and health checks

### 2. Demo Application Server (POC Testing Only)
**Location**: `apps/blockprotocol-poc/src/server.ts` (refactored)
**Purpose**: **Provide a web application for testing Block Protocol scenarios**
**Responsibilities** (Target State):
- Serve the demo web application frontend
- Load Block Builder & Server modules for continuous block reloading
- **Delegate entity graph management to IndexingService**
- Provide configurable test scenarios
- Optional WebSocket support for Block Protocol message testing

### 3. IndexingService (Entity Management)
**Location**: `packages/indexing-service/`
**Purpose**: **Manage entity graphs and handle Block Protocol operations**
**Responsibilities** (Current and Target State):
- Entity CRUD operations (`updateEntity`, `createEntity`, `deleteEntity`)
- File watching and synchronization with source code
- LSP integration for `vivafolio_data!()` constructs
- Event-driven architecture for entity changes
- Transport layer for Block Protocol messaging

### 4. VS Code Extension (Production Runtime)
**Location**: `src/extension.ts`
**Purpose**: **Integrate blocks into VS Code IDE**
**Responsibilities** (Current and Target State):
- Initialize IndexingService for entity management
- Render blocks in webviews using MiniHost and BlockResourcesCache
- Handle Block Protocol messaging between webviews hosting blocks and the extension host process
- Optional integration with local Block Builder & Server for development

## 1. Block Builder & Server Capabilities

### Core Duties (Block Building & Serving)
* **Framework compilation** – Hot-reload compilation for SolidJS, Vue, Svelte, Lit, Angular with proper bundling and optimization
* **Block packaging** – Build blocks for both development (hot-reload) and production (optimized bundles)
* **Resource serving** – Host `block-metadata.json`, bundle chunks, stylesheets, HTML entry points under predictable paths
* **Cache invalidation hooks** – Notify BlockResourcesCache when blocks are rebuilt for automatic webview updates

### Integration Duties (VS Code Extension)
* **Development API** – REST endpoints for block metadata, health checks, and development tools
* **Hot reload integration** – Real-time updates to running VS Code instances without restarts

### Testing Duties (POC Scenarios - Optional)
* **Scenario simulation** – Support configurable test scenarios with entity graphs for Block Protocol validation
* **WebSocket communication** – When needed for testing, provide WebSocket support for Block Protocol messages
* **Entity graph helpers** – Optional REST endpoints for graph inspection during development

**Important**: The Block Builder & Server focuses **only** on building and serving blocks. Entity graph management and Block Protocol message handling are **delegated to the IndexingService**.

## 2. Block Builder & Server CLI Contract

The Block Builder & Server executable accepts the following options (with environment variable fallbacks):

| Flag | Env | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--port <number>` | `PORT` | `4173` | TCP port for HTTP endpoints. Use `0` for an ephemeral port when embedding in tests. |
| `--host <string>` | `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address; the console banner should print the resolved host (`localhost` when unspecified). |
| `--no-vite` | `DEVSERVER_NO_VITE=1` | Enabled when `NODE_ENV !== production` | Disables Vite middleware and serves prebuilt assets. Useful for unit tests or when another bundler handles compilation. |
| `--log-routes` | `DEVSERVER_LOG_ROUTES=1` | Off | Emits `dumpExpressStack(app)` output after middleware registration. |

## 3. Block Builder & Server Programmatic API

```ts
import { startBlockBuilderServer } from './src/dev-server.ts'

const { httpServer, close } = await startBlockBuilderServer({
  port: 0,
  attachSignalHandlers: false,
  enableVite: false,
})

// use httpServer.address() to discover listening port
await close()
```

* `startBlockBuilderServer()` returns `{ app, httpServer, close }`. Call `close()` to tear down sockets and any Vite middleware.
* Flag `attachSignalHandlers=false` keeps the helper from registering process-wide SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers (essential for smoke tests).

## 4. Block Builder & Server Test Hooks

* `/healthz` – returns `{ ok: true, timestamp }` when the process is healthy.
* `/api/blocks` – lists available blocks and their metadata.
* `/api/blocks/{blockId}` – serves block metadata and resources.

A Node smoke test must launch the Block Builder & Server programmatically, assert the health endpoint, and shut it down cleanly.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap

### Current State (Phase G5.1 - Complete ✅)
- ✅ G5.1.1 - Architecture Foundation completed
- ✅ G5.1.2 - Block Builder & Server as Reusable Library completed
- ✅ G5.1.3 - Demo Application Server Refactor completed
- ✅ G5.1.4 - Production Local Development Mode completed
- ✅ G5.1.5 - Unified Development Experience completed

### 🎉 Unified Development Experience Complete ✅

**Achievement**: A complete block development workflow is now possible. A developer creates a new block type, tests it in the POC demo with real entity data, iterates on the design using local development mode in VS Code, and deploys it to production - all using the same underlying Block Builder & Server. The experience is seamless: blocks built for testing automatically work in production, local development provides instant feedback, and the entire workflow uses consistent tooling and APIs.

**Block Definition Edit Flow**:
1. Developer edits `blocks/color-picker/src/index.html`
2. Block Builder detects change and recompiles the block
3. Cache invalidation notifies all connected clients (demo app, VS Code)
4. Demo application reloads the updated block instantly
5. VS Code extension updates block webviews without restart
6. Developer sees visual changes immediately across all environments

**Source Code Edit Flow**:
1. Developer edits `gui_state("#ff0000")` in source file
2. LSP server detects change and sends VivafolioBlock notification
3. IndexingService receives notification and updates entity graph
4. Entity change events propagate to connected block webviews
5. Color picker block updates its displayed color
6. Bidirectional sync: block changes can update source code via LSP

**Remaining Tasks (Post-G5.1.5)**:
1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update development guides with unified workflow
   - Create troubleshooting documentation for common issues
   - Write migration guide from current architecture to unified system

## 6. Block Examples

When implementing the Block Builder & Server, refer to `docs/Coda-and-Notion-Blocks-POC.md` for concrete view/property blocks (TableView, BoardView, PersonChip, RelationCell, etc.). Each framework compilation pipeline should target that suite so the Block Builder & Server exercises realistic workloads.

## 7. Migration Notes

* **Entity Graph Management**: Currently handled by POC server, will be delegated to IndexingService
* **Framework Compilation**: Currently embedded in POC server, will be extracted to Block Builder & Server
* **Block Serving**: Currently embedded in POC server, will be extracted to Block Builder & Server
* **Test Scenarios**: Currently embedded in POC server, will remain but delegate entity operations

See `docs/BlockProtocol-E2E-POC.md` Phase G5.1 milestones for detailed implementation steps.
